Game Overview
  Game Summary
  Target Audience
    The audience we are hoping to target for the game during development would be the 7+ age group and also hoping to appeal to the fans
    of both the horror and mystery genre and fans of puzzle games.
    However we may decide at a later time to re-evaulate this while making the prototype. 
   
    
   Genre
    * We are aiming to create a horror style puzzle game for our prototype.
    
  Platform
    The main platform that we are hoping to develop the prototype of our game for is the PC but if we have the time, we may look at
    developing the game to play on mobile platforms - Android and iOS.

Functional Requirements
  The prototype must be able to load and fully fun on any platform - PC, Mobile, etc
  All functions of gameplay must work for the system that prototype is developed for - Arrow Keys/Keyboard/ Mouse for PC, Touch 
  Screen for Mobile, etc
  Any audio and assets that have not been created by us, must be referenced properly back to their creators and follow under the UK 
  copyright laws.
  
    
NonFunctional Requirements
  The prototype can be done in either 2-D or 3-D
  Assets can either be 2-D or 3-D 
  The prototype can be any genre - Horror, Fantasy, etc
  The prototype can be any style - RPG, 1st Person Shooter, etc
  The prototyoe can be created using any game engine available - Unity, Unreal Engine, Gamer Maker, etc.
  All audio used within the prototype must load and play within the game.
  
Constraints
  Time constraints - may not be able to implement all the aspects we want to the prototype.
  Computer system(s) may crash - lose any unsaved work or result in files coming corrupted.
  Games files end up corrupted or not compatible with other versions of Unity - save spare copies of game files to other sources -
  such as other computer system, usb drives and have one system with one version of Unity and another with the newer version
  as backup.
  Document files end up corrupted - save updated spare copies to multiple platforms such as e-mail, GitHub, etc
